#  derived from each other. Should, however, the interpretation of the
#  GNU GPL Version 3 ("License") under any applicable laws result in
#  KNIME and ECLIPSE being a combined program, KNIME AG herewith grants
#  you the additional permission to use and propagate KNIME together with
#  ECLIPSE with only the license terms in place for ECLIPSE applying to
#  ECLIPSE and the GNU GPL Version 3 applying for KNIME, provided the
#  license terms of ECLIPSE themselves allow for the respective use and
#  propagation of ECLIPSE together with KNIME.
#
#  Additional permission relating to nodes for KNIME that extend the Node
#  Extension (and in particular that are based on subclasses of NodeModel,
#  NodeDialog, and NodeView) and that only interoperate with KNIME through
#  standard APIs ("Nodes"):
#  Nodes are deemed to be separate and independent programs and to not be
#  covered works.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the
#  License, the License does not apply to Nodes, you are not required to
#  license Nodes under the License, and you are granted a license to
#  prepare and propagate Nodes, in each case even if such Nodes are
#  propagated with or for interoperation with KNIME.  The owner of a Node
#  may freely choose the license terms applicable to such Node, including
#  when such Node is propagated with or for interoperation with KNIME.
